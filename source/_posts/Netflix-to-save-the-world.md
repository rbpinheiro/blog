Across history we can see pretty much the same thing happening over and over, a small group controls information and filters what most people should be able to access. Some even change information to produce their own truths. The information that arrives to you has, most likely, already been modified or filtered according to someone else´s point of view or interest.

Around 1439 Gutenberg created a machine that would have a large impact on the world and on how information would be distributed. By making knowledge more accessible, Gutenberg´s new printing system created a revolution disrupting the structure of who hold the knowledge, and empowered the renaissance, the protestant reformation, the age of enlightenment and the scientific revolution.

In the 60s, the creation of networks of computers was again the beginning of a new disruptiveness, the internet makes information a lot easier to access and allows disruptive technologies and applications to grow faster. Every now and then something new comes up and causes chaos, Napster did it and was ultimately crushed, taxi apps did it for local taxi companies, Uber did it and caused mayhem on the streets when taxi drivers attacked the black cars.

If we analyze when things similar happened, we always see that by the end it is beneficial for the larger amount of the population and angers the small amount of people that are greatly benefited by how things work as they were before. We should embrace disruptiveness and force the wheels of power to spin on a different direction.

The uttermost media for misinformation and manipulation nowadays is television. The programming grid being created by the television companies gives them a huge amount of power to manipulate masses. The next big step we all should take is leave the conventional television industry and adopt content on demand, it´s better for you and it´s better for humanity. You should control what information you are going to consume and when you are going to do that, don’t delegate that to a generic commercial programming grid.
